                     <p>In April, a minority in the Senate blocked a measure that would raise the federal minimum wage. But states and cities across the country are refusing to wait for Congress. Local governments are taking matters into their own hands, moving forward on this issue to support working families.</p>
                     <p>On the summer solstice—the longest day of the year—hundreds of clean energy supporters across the country got together to inform people of the facts on solar power and encourage them to be a part of the growing movement. From tweeting to identifying places that could benefit from solar, volunteers got the word out that it’s time to #PutSolarOnIt.</p>
