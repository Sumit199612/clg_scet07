                    <p>Dear All,</p>
                    <p align="justify">I wish you all a very happy and successful New Year full of laurels and accolades.</p>
                    <p align="justify">I express my sincere thanks for placing your trust and confidence in me to lead SES â€“ a task I accept with deepest humility. I welcome all the new members to the Sarvajanikan fraternity and seek the kind support and commitment to steer SES to new vistas and pathways of success.</p>
                    <p align="justify">SES primarily being an Educational Institute, teachers are the torch bearers in all the activities and programmes of the Society. It shall be my endeavour to involve all worthy teachers in the ventures of SES with a view to enhance the image of SES and make its presence profoundly felt not only within the region but also in National &amp; International educational arenas.</p>
                    <p align="justify">I also strongly believe that we need to make sincere attempts to reach out to the policy makers, Industrial organizations to give our valuable inputs/services on many important policy issues/training programmes. This can be possible only when each one contributes his/her might as experts in the field. Equally significant is the initiative to recognize the young graduates-engineers as it is they who are the future leaders of tomorrow. We shall make efforts to seek their greater contribution in the activities of the society.</p>
                    <p align="justify">I shall always look forward to your suggestions and guidance for all inputs that lead to the continuing progress of SES. I wish you all a great success&nbsp; in all endeavours in the years to come.</p>

                    <p><strong>Kamlesh P. Yagnik</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Chairman, SES</strong></p>
